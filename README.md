# A minimal starting template for a p5.js "sketch", for CYF students

## What is this?

This is a minimal p5js project for CYF students who have finished the fantastic Khan Academy intro to js: drawing and anim course.

## What can I do with it?

You can fork this repo to start working on your own p5.js projects.

Perhaps use it to migrate some of your favourites from your Khan Academy work (and give them their own home by deploying on netlify or github pages).

## What does it look like when it runs?

To start with, it will look like this: https://codeyourfuture.github.io/p5js-minimal/

Make it cooler!
